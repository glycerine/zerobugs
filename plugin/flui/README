This is a new, experimental project.

I am trying to re-write the UI, with the following goals

1) Lightweight, to minimize dependencies and thus make it easier to build
   executables that work across several Linux distros. Right now gtkmm et. all
   creates quite a DLL hell.

2) Clean design. Right now there are potential dead-locks in the UI code
   (which has evolved organically and it is bloated)
