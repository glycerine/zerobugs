This is a new, experimental project.

I am writing a new UI based on Fltk, with the following goals:

1) Lightweight, minimize dependencies; make it easier to build
   executables that work across several Linux distros. Right now gtkmm et. all
   creates quite a heck of a DLL hell.

2) Clean, simple design. There are potential dead-locks in the current UI code
   (which has evolved organically and is bloated). The current UI also
   carries lots of gtkmm-1.2 baggage/garbage from back in the day.

   There's a lot of gunk around "marshalling" requests and responses between
   the main debugger thread and the UI thread. The code is unnecessarily complicated
   and involves too many mutexes (i.e. more than ONE)

3) Delay toolkit-related design decisions for as long as possible.
   The "ui" namespace contains code that is not Fltk (or any other toolkit) specific.

   Code in the global namespace is Fltk specific.
