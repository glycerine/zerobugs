This is  a Python-written prototype (work in progress) for the next version of the Zero UI.

Some TODO's carried over from the current (C++) version (in no particular order):

1) options dialog for specifying the numeric base in which registers are displayed in the registers view
2) command for unloading plugins
3) deduce language automatically from debug info, where available, rather than from file extensions, if doing syntax colouring.

4) provide a button or some other way of canceling time-consuming operations, or provide a user hint that something is going on

5) optimize lookups triggered by right-mouse button clicks

6) view global variables (possibly via Watch-es?)

7) configurable coloring and 
8) configurable hot-keys
