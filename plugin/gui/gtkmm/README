The GUI plug-in has been developed initially using the Gtkmm 1.2 library.

The reason for not going with 2.x (at that time, 2003-ish) was that I wanted to 
be able to run on RedHat 7.1 and 7.2 boxes, without having to upgrade to the 2.x 
suite of Gtk and gnome libraries.

I am now "porting" the UI code to Gtkmm 2.x, for a reverse rationale: I want
to run on Fedora boxes without having to install the old Gtk stuff.

The strategy that I chose is to make minimum changes to the UI code, and to
use the ADAPTER PATTERN. Widgets that have been deprecated in Gtk 2 (such as
List, CList, CTree, Text) are faked by using widgets with close functionality 
(TreeView, TextView), wrapped in adapter classes. The adapter classes implement
the same interfaces as the old widgets, in term of the new ones.

The "adapting" of new widgets into old widgets goes only as far as to cover the
needs for my GUI, it is not a general-purpose implementation.
