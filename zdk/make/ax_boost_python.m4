dnl This macro checks to see if the Boost.Python library is installed.
dnl It also attempts to guess the currect library name using several attempts.
dnl It tries to build the library name using a user supplied name or suffix 
dnl and then just the raw library.
dnl
dnl If the library is found, HAVE_BOOST_PYTHON is defined and BOOST_PYTHON_LIB 
dnl is set to the name of the library.
dnl
dnl This macro calls AC_SUBST(BOOST_PYTHON_LIB).
dnl
dnl In order to ensure that the Python headers are specified on the include path,
dnl this macro requires AX_PYTHON to be called.
