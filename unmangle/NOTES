[01/28/05] The ABI V3 demangler seems to work, although is about
5 times slower than Ian Taylor's C implementation. 

[02/06/05] The optimized code is now only less than 1.5 slower.
 Cannot optimize fully with gcc 2.95 and use -fsjlj-exceptions at
 same time. Using some custom, hand-written replacements for std
 containers helped a bit.

 The legacy mangling support for 2.95 is almost complete and 2 times
 FASTER than cplus_demangle, even with no optimization. Yeepee!

The cp-demangle stuff is here just for benchmarking purposes.
